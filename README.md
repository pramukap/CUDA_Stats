# Data Mining Parallel GPU Algorithms

This is the repo for EE 361C Multicore Term Project on Data Mining algorithms using CUDA. The algorithms we chose to implement are:
- Multiple Linear Regression (Closed Form Solution)
- Ridge Regularized Regression (Closed Form Solution)
- Logistic Regression (Iterative)
- KMeans Unsupervised Clustering (Iterative)

Each subdirectory has a readme, associated Makefile, and notebook or C main.
